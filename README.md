[![PyPI Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scireader)] (https://pypi.org/project/scireader/）

### Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, staying informed with the most relevant, up-to-date research and clinical outcomes is critical to life saving and crisis management. However, navigating through an already vast volume of literature that continues to grow in a head-spinnig speed is extremely difficult, preventing a timely information sharing and decision making. Aiming to trackle this challenge, in this work, we employ a semantic text mining approach to efficiently allocate and digest the most relevant literature given a query research task.

# scireader
SciReader is a ScispaCy-based natural language processing pipeline for scientific literature mining. To help combat the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been applied to find the most relevant literature given a query research topic.
